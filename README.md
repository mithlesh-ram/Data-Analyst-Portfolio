# 📊 Project Overview

## 1️⃣ Excel — Road Accident Dashboard

### 🔹 Objective

To analyze road accident data and create a dynamic dashboard that highlights casualty patterns, severity levels, and trends.

### 🔹 Steps Taken

* Data cleaning (removing duplicates, handling missing values)
* Created calculated columns
* Built Pivot Tables for KPI extraction
* Designed interactive dashboard layout
* Used slicers for filtering (Year, Severity, Vehicle Type)

### 🔹 Key Formulas Used

* `SUMIFS()` for conditional aggregation
* `COUNTIFS()` for multi-condition counting
* `IF()` for classification logic
* `VLOOKUP()` / `XLOOKUP()` for data mapping
* Percentage change formula for YoY growth
* Pivot Charts for dynamic visualization

### 🔹 Insights Found

* Majority of casualties occurred under specific road conditions
* Clear seasonal trend in accident frequency
* Certain vehicle types had significantly higher severity rates
* Urban areas showed different patterns compared to rural regions

## 2️⃣ Power BI — Interactive Accident Analytics Dashboard

### 🔹 Objective

To build a professional BI dashboard with dynamic KPIs and year-over-year comparison using Power BI.

### 🔹 Steps Taken

* Imported raw XML/CSV data
* Cleaned and transformed data using **Power Query**
* Created relationships between tables
* Built DAX measures for KPIs
* Designed interactive visuals with slicers and drill-through

### 🔹 DAX Measures Used

* Total Casualties = `SUM(Column)`
* YoY Growth % calculation
* CALCULATE() with filters
* Time Intelligence functions
* DIVIDE() for safe percentage calculation

### 🔹 Insights Found

* YoY casualty growth trends identified
* District-level mapping revealed accident hotspots
* Road type strongly influenced accident severity
* Light conditions significantly impacted fatal cases

## 3️⃣ SQL — Data Exploration & Query Analysis

### 🔹 Objective

To extract insights directly from raw accident datasets using SQL queries.

### 🔹 Steps Taken

* Imported CSV dataset into relational database
* Wrote aggregation queries
* Performed joins across multiple tables
* Applied window functions for ranking and trend analysis
* Used subqueries for nested filtering logic

### 🔹 SQL Techniques Used

* `GROUP BY` with aggregations
* `JOIN` (INNER, LEFT)
* `ROW_NUMBER()` / `RANK()` window functions
* Subqueries
* CASE statements for classification

### 🔹 Insights Found

* Identified top accident-prone districts
* Severity distribution by vehicle type
* Monthly accident growth pattern
* Hidden trends not visible in raw data
